# BribeYourselfFit - Gamified Fitness Tracker

> 🎯 **Open-source, self-hosted fitness tracking with streak-based motivation**

## 🤖 **Built with AI-Assisted Development**

This project was created using modern AI-powered development tools, demonstrating the power of human-AI collaboration in software development:

- ⚡ **Live Coding Sessions**: Built live using AI pair programming and systematic debugging
- 🧠 **Claude (Anthropic)**: Primary AI assistant for architecture, code generation, documentation, and problem-solving
- 👨‍💻 **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion and intelligent suggestions
- 🏗️ **Human Expertise**: AECO/BIM industry knowledge and project direction by [The BIMsider](https://bio.link/thebimsider)

**Why this matters:** This showcases how AI tools can help domain experts (like AECO professionals) create sophisticated web applications without traditional programming backgrounds, while maintaining high code quality and best practices through systematic debugging and iterative development.

## 🤔 **Why This App Exists**

Sometimes when you're trying to lose weight or be more active, you need accountability. But accountability means different things to different people. For some, it's just tracking numbers. For others - like me - you need an incentive, a motive, a real reason for doing something.

Back in the 2000s when The Biggest Loser was popular, friends would get together for weight loss competitions. There'd be something on the line - $50, a night out, bragging rights - and the winner would take it all. That external motivation helped people actually track their stats, log their weights, and do the work.

**But here's the thing:** Not everyone is motivated by money or new clothes or the same rewards. Every person's fitness journey is different.

That's why BribeYourselfFit was born - a fitness tracker that lets you set your own rewards, your own "bribes" for hitting your goals. Whether it's a cheat meal after a 7-day streak, new workout gear at 30 days, or a weekend getaway at 100 days - you decide what motivates you.

## 🎮 **How It Works**

BribeYourselfFit combines simple daily tracking with powerful motivation:

### **Daily Tracking Made Simple**
- **Weight**: Log weekly (because daily fluctuations are noise)
- **Steps**: Your daily movement goal
- **Exercise**: Minutes + type (cardio, strength, yoga, etc.)
- **Water**: Hydration tracking
- **Wellness Score**: 5-point daily checklist:
  - ✅ Avoided sugary drinks
  - ✅ 5+ servings fruits & vegetables  
  - ✅ Practiced portion control
  - ✅ No eating after 8 PM
  - ✅ 7+ hours of sleep

### **Streak-Based Motivation**
- **Individual streaks** for each goal (steps, exercise, water, wellness)
- **Overall streak** when you hit ALL daily goals
- **Visual progress** with streak calendars and charts
- **Built-in milestones** at 7, 14, 30, 50, 100+ days

### **Your Custom Rewards**
The magic happens in the rewards system. Set your own "bribes":
- **7-day streak**: Favorite cheat meal
- **14-day streak**: New workout playlist
- **30-day streak**: New athletic shoes
- **50-day streak**: Massage or spa day
- **100-day streak**: Weekend vacation

You know what motivates you. The app just helps you stay accountable to your own system.
